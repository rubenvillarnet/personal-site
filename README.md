# My personal site

This is my personal website, developed with the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: front-end framework.
- **Framer Motion**: animation library.
- **Styled components**: CSS styles.
- **Redux**: state management.
- Deployed to **Vercel**.

## To do

- [ ] Improve _README.md_.
- [ ] Translate site to English.
- [ ] Improve animations.
- [ ] Rethink light theme's color scheme.
- [ ] Save theme preference in a cookie instead of in LocalStorage.
- [ ] Add proyects / portfolio.
- [ ] Use Context API instead of Redux.
- [ ] Add blog (someday...?).
